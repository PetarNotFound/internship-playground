***1. What is an API, in your own words?***
api stands for application programming interface and acts as a sort of a messenger who takes your request for something that you want to do and then sends a response back to you



***2. What does an API actually do when a user clicks "Submit" on a web form?***

it sends a fetch request to the server which then sends back the data for the user to view for example the model of a car or motorbike that we want, the cost for plane tickets and more



***3. What's the difference between a GET and a POST request?***

GET is used to retrieve data from a server while POST is used to send data to the server 





***4. Give an example of an app you use daily that probably uses APIs (Instagram, Uber, etc.)***

Steam uses apis for a lot of things one example is its steam library which sends an api to fetch owned games and displays them for you



***5. What's something you're still unsure about?***

i got confused trying to understand how rest apis work
